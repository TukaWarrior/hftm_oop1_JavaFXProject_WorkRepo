# hftm_oop1_JavaFXProject
 This is my personal java fx project for school.  It is a graded exercise to test our newly learned skills in JavaFX. 
 
 __What is this project going to be?__  
When finished, this program will be a small utility to keep track of read books, watched movies and tv-shows and played games.
